## Installation

To get started with Venice AI, install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install venice-ai
```

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. If you encounter issues, refer to the [Releases](https://github.com/lelyanalkhamaiseh/venice-ai/releases) section for the latest version and updates.

## Getting Started

After installation, you can start using Venice AI in your Python projects. Import the library and initialize it with your API key.

```python
import venice_ai

client = venice_ai.Client(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
```

Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key. 

## Usage

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous

Venice AI supports both synchronous and asynchronous calls. You can choose the method that best fits your application's architecture.

#### Synchronous Example

```python
response = client.chat("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)
```

#### Asynchronous Example

For asynchronous usage, ensure you have an event loop running.

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    response = await client.chat_async("Hello, how are you?")
    print(response)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Error Handling

Venice AI has built-in error handling. If an error occurs, the client raises exceptions that you can catch and handle.

```python
try:
    response = client.chat("What is the weather today?")
except venice_ai.Error as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Examples

### Chat

The chat feature allows you to create conversational agents.

```python
response = client.chat("Tell me a joke.")
print(response)
```

### Image Generation

Generate images based on textual descriptions.

```python
image = client.generate_image("A futuristic city skyline at sunset.")
image.show()
```

### Text-to-Speech

Convert text to audio with ease.

```python
audio = client.text_to_speech("Hello, welcome to Venice AI.")
audio.play()
```
